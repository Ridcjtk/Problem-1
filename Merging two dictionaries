def simple_merge_max_mappings(dict1, dict2):
    """ Merges two dictionaries based on the largest value in a given mapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dict1 : Dict[Any, Comparable]
    dict2 : Dict[Any, Comparable]

    Returns
    -------
    Dict[Any, Comparable]
        The merged dictionary

    for key in dict2:
        if key not in merged or dict2[key] > merged[key]:
            merged[key] = dict2[key]
    return merged


Main problem is merging two dictionaries without interferring with the original. 

Marge_max_mappings + dict(dict1) ensures that a new dictionaries is created each time dictionary 1 and 2 is combed over.

Adds in dict2 with dict 1 using merged[key] = dict2[key]
